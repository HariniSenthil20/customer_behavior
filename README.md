Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Dashboarding

Overview:

    This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to insights visualization. The process includes data loading and exploration in Python, data cleaning, SQL-based analysis using PostgreSQL, and building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to communicate findings effectively.
    The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills, including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), querying relational databases, and presenting insights in a business-friendly format.

Project Steps:

1.	Data Loading:

            o	Imported raw data into Python using Pandas.
  	
            o	Performed initial inspection to understand structure and data types.

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

            o	Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.
  	
            o	Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

3.	Data Cleaning:

            o	Handled missing and invalid values.
  	
            o	Standardized formats and corrected data types.
  	
            o	Prepared clean datasets for SQL analysis and visualization.

4.	SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL):

            o	Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.
            
            o	Wrote SQL queries to calculate key metrics and answer business questions.
            
            o	Optimized queries for clarity and performance.

5.	Dashboard Development:

            o	Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL.
  	
            o	Built interactive visuals and KPIs.
  	
            o	Designed a clear, user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders.

6.	Reporting
	
            o	Summarized findings and insights.
  	
            o	Highlighted trends, patterns, and actionable conclusions.
